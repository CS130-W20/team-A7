# Serendipity Overview
An app for those who are spontaneous but indecisive to make travel plans. Take a blind date with a city!
Made by a dedicated team of five UCLA students: Jair Hinojosa, Steven Lara, Christina Oliveira, Kyle Romero, and Kevin Tan.

# Code Structure
  Since we decided to build a React application, we utilize a standard structure for React apps in which we store all components inside client/src/components. Within this folder, we keep each component in a seperate file. This is the main structure of our critical components:
  
  client  
    -src  
      --assets  
        ---[..assets..]  
      --components  
        ---About  
        ---Account  
        ---Admin  
        ---App  
        ---CTAButton  
        ---Firebase  
        ---Home  
        ---Landing  
        ---MyTrips  
        ---NavBar  
        ---PasswordChange  
        ---PasswordForget  
        ---Session  
        ---SignIn  
        ---SignOut  
        ---SignUp  
        ---TripGeneration  
      --constants  

# Testing

Tests can be found under client/src/components/App/README.md, since App constitutes the main React functionality.
