#Test Cases
Test 'NavBar loads' tests the functionality of the NavBar by rendering a NavBar and checking for expected text.

Test 'Landing Page loads' tests the functionality of the Landing Page by rendering a Landing Page and checking for expected text.

Test 'About Page loads' tests the functionality of the About Page loads by rendering a About Page loads and checking for expected text.

Test 'SignIn loads' tests the functionality of the SignIn loads by rendering a SignIn loads and checking for expected text.
Note: our use of Firebase limited our ability to write broad scoping unit tests as it requires initilization that we couldnt mock. 

We did most of our testing through Chrome Developer Tools and visual inspection. 

Additionally, we used specialized API testing tools as detailed in our Report.
